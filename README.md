<h1>Abstract</h1>


The device insurance market is underdeveloped compared to sectors like health, automotive, and property. Our project bridges this gap by offering a user-friendly web app to insure essential devices such as mobile phones and laptops. Traditional challenges in managing insurance deals, like adding new products to a database through coding, are simplified by our advanced Insurance CRM, which automates product setup and policy processes, reducing complexity and errors. Users can create profiles, input device details, and choose from various insurance plans that cover risks ranging from theft and snatching to cracked screens, malfunctions, or even explosions. The platform streamlines the process by enabling users to upload documents and secure comprehensive coverage through a few simple steps. Our Insurance CRM introduces automation, modularity, and connectivity between underwriters and reinsurers, offering a dynamic form-based interface for product addition and real-time tracking to ensure a smooth user experience. The CRM also allows customization of perils and provides an efficient premium calculation method for accurate estimates across diverse devices and damage scenarios. A key differentiator of our solution is an AI-powered chatbot that serves as a virtual assistant, guiding users through every step with real-time support, answering queries, and clarifying options, ensuring an intuitive and hassle-free experience akin to interacting with a sales agent. This innovation focuses on creating a simple and transparent insurance journey, eliminating complex forms and confusing terms. Our approach makes device insurance accessible to all, from students insuring laptops to professionals safeguarding work phones. By
integrating user-centric technology and AI-driven assistance, our solution aims to revolutionize device insurance, making it as easy as online shopping. Users can quickly insure their devices, gaining peace of mind knowing they are protected against unforeseen damages.
